# cuban-percussion-samples
A sample library of cuban percussion instruments and patterns

# Library Contents

The library currently contains samples for congas and timbales (including campana, contracampana, jam block, and cha bell) playing all the techniques described [here](github.com/wkosmos/cuban-percussion-midi).\
Each sample is recorded at 3 dynamic levels, with 4 alternate samples (for a length 5 round robin setup).
